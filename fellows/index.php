                <p>I work with governments because, when operated well, they can improve the lives of so many people. I work with civic startups at the <a href="#"><abbr title="Code for America">CfA</abbr> Accelerator</a> because, when operated well, they can improve the efficiency of so many governments. Every positive change I made working in government in Newark, N.J. might effect tens of thousands of families and every civic startup I mentor might affect hundreds of governments.</p>
                
                <p>But let me take a step back: I started to care so much about government and their inner workings because local government changed the course of my life.</p>
                
                <p>When I was ten years old, my mother and I were in a terrible car accident. Although I did not realize it then, the next few hours came to define my life. At the time I was confused. Now I vividly recall the kindness of the child welfare workers and their help in what was a scary situation for me. My conversations and their actions that day instilled in me a value that I will never forget: the power of a few individuals to profoundly affect a person in need.</p>
                
                <p>It became clear that my mother was an alcoholic. My stepfather filed for divorce, and my parents (guided by child welfare) agreed that I would live with my dad. For years I did not understand what had happened, but in time I came to appreciate who the social workers were and the profound effect that a working and compassionate government can have on peoples lives. Or, in my case, just one life. Their careful and kind work made it so I could eventually go on to lead the life Iâ€™ve had.</p>
