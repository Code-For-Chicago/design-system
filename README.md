# Code for Chicago Design System
It is a design system.

## Getting Started
1. To run locally, you will need `gem` and Ruby's `bundle` installed.
2. Run `bundle` to install dependencies.
3. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This will build the static site and watch for changes.
4. Visit `http://localhost:4000` in your browser to see the style guide.

## Prerequisites

### Ruby
It is advisable to avoid using the OS install of Ruby that comes bundled with MacOS, Ubuntu, and others. Instead we'd suggest using a Ruby virtual environment like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation).

To verify your ruby version:

```
> ruby -v
ruby 2.5.5p157 (2019-03-15 revision 67260) [x86_64-linux-gnu]
```

You should have at least ruby 2.1.0.

### Bundler
To install bundler, use:
```
> gem install bundler
```
